Throughout the build i was constantly checking in the dev tools that the code i was applying was effective and applying correctly.

I have gone through every page on my website and checked the responsiveness for various different screen sizes.

## AUTOMATED TESTING

### W3C Validator

[W3C](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) I used the W3C validator to make sure all my code was correct in the html, And for css i used W3C jigsaw.

### Lighthouse

I used Lighthouse within the Chrome Developer Tools to test the performance, accessibility, best practices and SEO of the website. (come back)

### Desktop Results (come back)

All pages of the site are achieving a score of 100 across the 4 categories.

### Full Testing

Full testing was performed on the following devices:

* Laptop:
  * Macbook Pro 2021 14 inch screen
* Mobile Devices:
  * iPhone 13 pro.
  * iPhone 11 pro.
  * Phone X.

* I tested the devices on Google Chrome.

(needs reviewing)
Additional testing was taken by friends and family on a variety of devices and screen sizes. They reported no issues when playing.

One tester in peer code review stated that the bottom of the play screen was cut off when testing on an iphone SE (2nd gen). I was unable to replicate this issue using google chrome developer tools.
