## User Experience (UX)

#### First Time Visitor Goals

* I want to take part in a history website online and improve my knowledge of Churchill.
* I want the site to be responsive to my device.
* I want the site to be easy to navigate.

#### Returning Visitor Goals

* I want them to be able to look at specific aspects of Churchillâ€™s life and know how to navigate to pages which have things relating to their specific interests.

#### Frequent Visitor Goals

* I want to be able to sign up to become part of Churchills fan club.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

I have gone with the black and white theme to represent photography in World War 2 in which Churchills career had really taken off.

In my css files i have declared the colour codes to be used on my website. 

* I have used `#595959` & `#ffffff` `#rgb(0, 0, 0)` as the primary and secondary colours used for the sites text.
* All other colours are imbeded in various images directly.

### Typography

Google Fonts was used to import the chosen fonts for use in the site.

* For the Page Title I have used the google font [bebas-neue](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bebas+Neue?preview.text=Winstons%20Fan%20Club&preview.text_type=custom&query=bebas). I chose bebas-neue because it is a clear font that looks clear on all screen sizes.

![bebas-neue-regular](assets/images/bebas-neue-regular.png)

* For the body of the page I have used the google font [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato?preview.text=Winstons%20Fan%20Club&preview.text_type=custom&query=lato). i chose lato because again it is easily readable clear and clean.

### Features

The website is comprised of a home page, a history page, and a signup page, and a basic thank you page for those who sign up.

All Pages on the website are responsive and have:

* A favicon in the browser tab.

  ![favicon](assets/images/favy.png)

* The title of the site at the top of every page. This title also acts as a link back to the home page.

![Home page image](assets/images/home-page.png)

The history page consists of more information about Winston Churchill at different stages in his life.

The signup page consists of a signup form to signup for daily emails about Churchill and the Club.

![Signup page image](assets/images/signup-page.png) 

#### Future Implementations

In future implementations I would like to:

1. I would like to add an interactive timeline, to let visitors explore a more interactive approach to history.
2. I would like to make the home page more welcoming, And add more sub pages regarding specific important events in Churchill's life.
3. I'd like to add a custom cursor when you hover over buttons. 
4. I would like to add a video of one of Churchill's speeches.
5. I would also like a much better thank you page.

### Accessibility

I have included image-to-text to improve accessability for visually impaired visitors.

* All of the fonts used are part of the san serif font family to help those with dyslexia to read more clearly.
* I have used similar colours throughout the site to provide the same experience for colour blind users.

* [Github](https://github.com/) - To save and store the files for the website.

* [GitPod](https://gitpod.io/) - IDE used to create the site.

* [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - To import the fonts used on the website.

## Testing

### Solved Bugs

| No | Bug | How I solved the issue |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | I had an issue with responsiveness on pages of different devices because i had written the media queries wrong, I have fixed those issue by rewritting various code across all media queries |

### Known Bugs

* Known bug: Title - If you click left or right of the title on any page, it sends the user back to the homepage. I intend to fix this so that only clicking on the actual title text redirects the user to the homepage.

## Credits

### Code Used

* I used [Chat GPT](https://openai.com/index/chatgpt/) To help when i was unsure what elements to use, but never copied direct code from Chat GPT, For example, I used ChatGTP to suggest various types of fonts which would be easy to read for people with dyslexia, and if i had got stuck on something i would ask which code i was missing or how can i achieve x.

* I used [Code Institute love running project](https://learn.codeinstitute.net/courses/course-v1:CodeInstitute+LRFX101+4/courseware/e805068059af42af87681032aa64053f/1da6ad13213740f1855a51d30a2375b1/) As refrence at times to adhere to good coding practice, The code that i have copied at any point has be mentioned with a comment in my code.

### Content

Except where mentioned content was created by me, except for images which were found on google, and historical facts that were generated from Chat GPT.
